# Themes folder in Hexo

It is ment to be easy setup but actually in Hexo you need to be very careful how you choosing theme, as it is a web site.
You could potentially deploy same thing with nodejs and expressjs.

It is not very straight forward it is actually more or less building the entire thing from scratch.



## Snippets 

# Random list

 const shuffleArray = arr => arr
  .map(a => [Math.random(), a])
  .sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0])
  .map(a => a[1]);
